            <h2>Review After a Year</h2>
            <p>I've been using this for a year now, and I’ve gotta say, as an e-learning designer (I make interactive e-learning packages, incl. video) who is temporarily staying in Canada, it’s been pretty cool—no contract lol!</p>
            <p>I can upload and download huge files without any issues. Like, 500 MB and sometimes even 10 GB for those 4K short learning videos (10-15 mins long). I’ve never had a single offline moment, maybe during midnight?</p>
            <p>Honestly, I think this is perfect for students or anyone who’s just here temporarily (like me, LOL). Super flexible and easy to use for all my e-learning resources.</p>

  <h2>🛜OXIO: My Experience & Answers to Common Questions👋</h2><br><br>
    
    <h3>1. What does OXIO offer?</h3>
    <p>I use OXIO for home internet, and it's been great! They offer high-speed plans (up to 1 Gbps) with no contracts, no price hikes, and no hidden fees. They even provide a FREE eero 6 router and straightforward!</p>
    
    <h3>2. Why is OXIO better than other internet providers?</h3>
    <p>The biggest reason? No BS😂 What they advertise is exactly what you get—no sneaky price increases after a few months, no weird extra charges, and no contracts tying you down. So if you don’t like it, you can just cancel!</p><br><br>
    
    <h2>🙋 Signing Up & Getting Started</h2>
    
    <h3>3. How do I sign up for OXIO?</h3>
    <p>Super easy! I just went to their website, put in my address, and signed up online <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oxio.ca/reel/CpWf7WZDL7j/?ref=article&hl=ne">(✨✨Press here to start the process!✨✨)</a>. It only took a few minutes. If you ever need help, their customer service will actually email you back lol, so it’s responsive for me!</p>
    
    <h3>4. Do I need a technician to set it up?</h3>
    <p>It depends on your place! If your home is already set up, you might just need to plug in the modem and go. Either way, they make it pretty hassle-free.</p>
    
    <h3>5. How do I activate my internet?</h3>
    <p>Once everything is set up, they send an email letting you know when it's good to go. If you needed a tech, they mention that it usually takes 1-3 hours after they leave for activation, but mine just worked fine right after activation. You may need a coaxial cable <a href="https://www.instagram.com/oxio.ca/reel/CpWf7WZDL7j/?ref=article&hl=ne">(see OXIO Video)</a>. Get it from Temu! It's cheap there!</p><br><br>
    
    <h2>⚙️ Service & Customer Support</h2>
    
    <h3>6. How do I contact OXIO if I need help?</h3>
    <p>They don’t do phone support, but they have digital support every day from 8 AM to 10 PM. You can reach them through:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Facebook Messenger</li>
        <li>Instagram DMs</li>
        <li>Email: bonjour@oxio.ca</li>
        <li>Text: 1-877-799-6033</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I’ve messaged them a couple of times, and they usually respond pretty fast.</p>
    
    <h3>7. Why doesn’t OXIO have phone support?</h3>
    <p>Honestly, I was skeptical about this at first, but it actually makes sense. Messaging is way faster than waiting on hold, and you can send screenshots or pictures if there’s an issue. At least they do things way faster than some public services LMAO.</p>
    
    <h3>8. Are there any extra fees for setup or activation?</h3>
    <p>Nope! No setup fees, no installation fees, no equipment rental fees. Even the technician visit (if you need one) is free.</p>
    
    <h3>9. How long does it take to get connected?</h3>
    <p>For me, it took about a week and a half from sign-up to having internet~~.</p>
    
    <h3>10. What if my internet stops working?</h3>
    <p>Hasn’t happened to me🤞, so here’s the answer from OXIO:<br>
