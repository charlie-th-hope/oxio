            <h2>Review After a Year</h2>
            <p>I've been using this for a year now, and I’ve gotta say, as an e-learning designer (I make interactive e-learning packages, incl. video) who is temporarily staying in Canada, it’s been pretty cool—no contract lol!</p>
            <p>I can upload and download huge files without any issues. Like, 500 MB and sometimes even 10 GB for those 4K short learning videos (10-15 mins long). I’ve never had a single offline moment, maybe during midnight?</p>
            <p>Honestly, I think this is perfect for students or anyone who’s just here temporarily (like me, LOL). Super flexible and easy to use for all my e-learning resources.</p>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">1. What does OXIO offer?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">I use OXIO for home internet, and it's been great! They offer high-speed plans (up to 1 Gbps) with no contracts, no price hikes, and no hidden fees. They even provide a FREE eero 6 router and straightforward!</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">2. Why is OXIO better than other internet providers?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">The biggest reason? No BS😂 What they advertise is exactly what you get lol no sneaky price increases after a few months, no weird extra charges, and no contracts tying you down. So if you don’t like it, you can just cancel!</div>
        </div>

        <h3>🙋Signing Up & Getting Started</h3>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">3. How do I sign up for OXIO?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">Super easy! I just went to their website, put in my address, and signed up online. It only took a few minutes. If you ever need help, their customer service will actually email you back lol, so it’s responsive for me!</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">4. Do I need a technician to set it up?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">It depends on your place! If your home is already set up, you might just need to plug in the modem and go. Either way, they make it pretty hassle free.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">5. How do I activate my internet?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">Once everything is set up, they send an email letting you know when it's good to go. If you needed a tech, they mention that it usually takes 1-3 hours after they leave for activation, but mine just worked fine right after the activation. You may need a coaxial cable, get it from Temu! It's cheap there!</div>

        <h3>⚙️Service & Customer Support</h3>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">6. How do I contact OXIO if I need help?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                They don’t do phone support, but they have digital support every day from 8 AM to 10 PM. You can reach them through:<br>
                <br>
                - Facebook Messenger<br>
                - Instagram DMs<br>
                - Email: bonjour@oxio.ca<br>
                - Text: 1-877-799-6033<br>
                <br>
                I’ve messaged them a couple of times, and they usually respond pretty fast.

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">7. Why doesn’t OXIO have phone support?</button>
            <div class="faq-answer">Honestly, I was skeptical about this at first, but it actually makes sense. Messaging is way faster than waiting on hold, and you can send screenshots or pictures if there’s an issue. At least they do things way faster than some public services LMAO.</div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">8. Are there any extra fees for setup or activation?</button>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">9. How long does it take to get connected?</button>

        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <button class="faq-question">10. What if my internet stops working?</button>
